# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Anlysis
V. Isualize is the CEO of PyBer and she has asked that we analyze ride-sharing data by city type and present a graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. PyBer 
PyBer operates in 120 cities classified into Urban, Suburban and Rural types. Total rides, drivers and fares, as well as avergae fare per ride and per driver was calculated based on city type. 
The summary includes total rides, drivers and fares, as well as avergae fare per ride and per driver based on city type. This summary allows us to compare each type and get insights on possible ways to improve profit. The line graph shows the total fare by city type from January to April with a weekly trend. 
## Results
1. Ride-sharing summary by city type
- A trend is present between the population of the city and the number of rides and drivers. In terms of population by city type, urban has the highest population density then suburban and rural has the lowest population density.
- Since urban cities have a high population density it has more rides and drivers. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver are the lowest of the three type. These may be due to the distance traveled per ride in urban cities as well as the number of drivers available. Additionally the demand for rides in urban cities is higher due to population density. 
- Suburban (30.97) avergae fare per ride is 12% lower than in rural (34.62) areas, this may be due to the number of drivers available.
- Average fare per driver is the highest in rural cities and may be due to two factors: distance traveled and number of drivers.

 2. Weekly Trend of total fare by city type from January to April 2019
 -  At the end of February all three city types have an increase in fares.
 -  Urban cities has a slow start in January and mid February, has a high variability during March and stabilizes in April.
 -  Suburban cities start slow during the first week of January and picks up during the rest of the month. There is a noticable decline in the beginning of April that does not last since it picks up the rest of the month. 
 -  Rural cities has it's highest demand in the first days of April.

## Summary
Based on the analysis above, the business recommencations are: 

- If the focus is increasing profit while keeping the current drivers and riders, during the peak days of each city type PyBer may consider increasing the fare price by a relatively unoticable percentage to the rider. To apply this increase, it may be useful to first understand if this trend is constant over the years and if the number of rides also increase. 
- Investing in additional drivers in rural and suburban areas will expand the market and possibly bring more riders. Collecting the data of attempts by riders can give more light into the number of drivers needed to cover the demand.
- Knowing the number of cancelled rides due to lack of drivers can give further insight if drivers are needed or if the focus should be on marketing PyBer to increase the number of customers.
